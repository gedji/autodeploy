## 🚀 Before You Start (5 minutes)

### You Need:
1. **A computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. **Python 3.8+** ([Download here](https://python.org)) - for local setup
3. **Docker Desktop** ([Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) - optional
4. **OpenAI Account** ([Sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/)) with billing enabled

### Quick Setup:
```bash
# 1. Download AutoDeploy
git clone <repository>
cd autodeploy

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your OpenAI API key

# 3. Choose setup method
# Method A: Local Python (Recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Method B: Docker (Alternative)
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios (Fun Part!)

### 🌐 Scenario 1: "I Want a Simple Website"

**Your Goal**: Create a basic website that anyone can visit

**Local Python Commands**:
```bash

```

**Docker Command**:
```bash
docker-compose exec app python src/main.py "Deploy a production application with maximum security and compliance"
```

**What AutoDeploy Does**:
- 🔐 Encrypts everything (data at rest and in transit)
- 🔑 Sets up proper access controls
- 📋 Adds audit logging
- 🚨 Configures security monitoring
- 💾 Sets up encrypted backups

**You'll See**: Enterprise-grade security configurations!

# Mac/Linux
.venv/bin/python src/main.py "Deploy a portfolio website with global CDN for fast loading"
```

**Docker Command**:
```bash
docker-compose exec app python src/main.py "Deploy a portfolio website with global CDN for fast loading"
```

**What AutoDeploy Does**:
- 🌍 Sets up Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- ⚡ Optimizes for fast loading worldwide
- 📱 Configures for mobile and desktop
- 📊 Adds analytics and performance monitoring

**You'll See**: Infrastructure optimized for global reach!

### 🛒 Scenario 5: "I Want an Online Store"

**Your Goal**: E-commerce website with payment processing

**Local Python Commands**:
```bash
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\python.exe src/main.py "Deploy an e-commerce website with payment processing and inventory management"

# Mac/Linux
.venv/bin/python src/main.py "Deploy an e-commerce website with payment processing and inventory management"
```

**Docker Command**:
```bash
docker-compose exec app python src/main.py "Deploy an e-commerce website with payment processing and inventory management"
```

**What AutoDeploy Does**:
- 🛒 Sets up web servers for the store

## 🎯 Understanding the Results

### What Those Files Mean:
- **`provider.tf`**: "Hello AWS, this is us"
- **`vm.tf`**: "Create virtual computers with these specs"
- **`network.tf`**: "Set up internet connections and routing"
- **`security.tf`**: "Create firewalls and access controls"
- **`variables.tf`**: "Settings that can be customized"
- **`outputs.tf`**: "Important info like website URLs"

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ **Green checkmarks**: Everything worked!
- 📄 **Multiple .tf files**: Complete infrastructure created
- 🔢 **File sizes (like "1204 characters")**: Substantial configurations generated
- 🎉 **"All tests passed!"**: Core components verified

### If Something Goes Wrong:
- ❌ **Red errors**: Usually API key or Docker issues
- 🔄 **Restart**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
- 🆘 **Get help**: Check the main README troubleshooting section

## 🎪 Advanced Testing (When You're Ready)

### Interactive Mode:
